## 🧠 How It Works

- The **animated background** uses `@keyframes` with moving gradient orbs.
- **Search bar** uses event listeners to show placeholder suggestions.
- Clicking a product card shows **AI-powered insights** via toast notifications.
- CSS gradients and blur effects simulate a **glass UI** for modern design.
